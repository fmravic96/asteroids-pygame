# Asteroids (Pygame)

This is a simple Asteroids clone built with Python and Pygame. Control your ship, shoot asteroids, and try to survive as long as possible!

## Setup & Running

1. **Install Python 3.10+** (if not already installed).
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. **Run the game:**
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Controls

- `W` / `S`: Move forward/backward
- `A` / `D`: Rotate left/right
- `SPACE`: Shoot

## Future Improvements

- Add a scoring system
- Implement multiple lives and respawning
- Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
- Add acceleration to the player movement
- Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
- Add a background image
- Create different weapon types
- Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
- Add a shield power-up
- Add a speed power-up
